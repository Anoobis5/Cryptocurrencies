# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Overview

Our task is to provide a report that includes which cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for our client's new cryptocurrency investment portfolio it will be providing to their customers. The data we will be using will need to be processed to fit an unsupervised machine learning model. To group the currencies, we will use a clustering algorithm and visualize our data findings. 


## Analysis


## Project Summary

Using our Unsupervised Machine Learning model, we can identify the classifications of 532 cryptocurrencies based on similarities in their features. We will need to further analyze each group to determine their potentiala and their growth performance to best suit the needs of our client and their customers.
